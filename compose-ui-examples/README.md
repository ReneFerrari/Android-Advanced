## Small Compose UI Samples
In the task folder you will find the task to complete. Ideally you would try to solve it without using the existing examples as reference, however if you really struggle you can ofc check them.

- CategorySelectionScreen contains a Composable Screen with LazyColumn (List) usage
- ReviewScreen contains a Composable Screen with SearchBar and more Complex UI Components
- ProductCard shows a simple ProductCard implementation

Every File has the Figma design linked at the Top. 

Colors and Fonts are defined in the Colors.kt and TextStyles.kt according to specification from the Figma.

The Figma works using a DesignSystem - meaning colors, fonts, components (like Buttons) are defined and then merged together to create a Screen. This is how you'd also do it in the real world.
